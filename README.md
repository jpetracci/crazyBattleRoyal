================

I was playing around with Three.js and my kids had me make this.

Just a simple program that produces some squares that try to reach the other side of the board. Collisions result in big booms. There is a score and all!

You (and my kids, HI!) can view it [here](http://www.petracci.org/crazyBattleRoyal/).
